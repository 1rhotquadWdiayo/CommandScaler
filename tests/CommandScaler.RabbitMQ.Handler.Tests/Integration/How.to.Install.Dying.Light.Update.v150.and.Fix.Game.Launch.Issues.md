The file size is about 4 MB and it contains a folder named "Dying.Light.Update.v1.5.0.Installation.Fix-BAT". Extract the folder to your desktop or any other location.
 
## Step 2: Copy the Files to the Game Directory
 
The next step is to copy the files from the folder "Dying.Light.Update.v1.5.0.Installation.Fix-BAT" to your game directory, where you have installed Dying Light. The default location is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dying Light". If you have changed the location, you can find it by right-clicking on Dying Light in your Steam library, selecting "Properties", clicking on the "Local Files" tab, and then clicking on "Browse Local Files".
 
Once you have located your game directory, copy all the files from the folder "Dying.Light.Update.v1.5.0.Installation.Fix-BAT" and paste them into your game directory, overwriting any existing files if prompted.
 
## Step 3: Delete the Debug Key from Steam
 
The final step is to delete the debug key from Steam, which was also removed by the update v1.5.0 and may cause some errors when launching the game. To do this, open Steam and go to your library. Right-click on Dying Light and select "Properties". Click on the "General" tab and then click on "Set Launch Options". A window will pop up with a text box. Delete any text that is in the box and click on "OK". Close the properties window and exit Steam.
 
## Step 4: Launch Dying Light and Enjoy
 
Now you are ready to launch Dying Light and enjoy the game with the latest update v1.5.0 installed. To launch the game, you can either double-click on DyingLightGame.exe in your game directory or open Steam and click on "Play" under Dying Light in your library.
